<h2>Use Case 3 - Rafael De Smet</h2>

This part will discuss the validation of Use Case 3. Below you can find the full Use Case, the UML sequence diagram, the regular expression and the FSA. The implementation and its results on the given trace file are discussed as well.
<br>
The behaviour of use case 3 is as follows: If a train is on the junction, all traffic lights will remain red until that train has left the junction.

<h3>Full Use Case</h3>

This use case description is based on the use case template provided in the assignment.
<br>
<br>

<b>Use Case</b>: TrainOnJunction <br>
<b>Actors</b>: Train on segment 3 <br>
<b>Scope</b>: Railway Junction Control System <br>
<b>Intention</b>: Lights of incoming tracks have to remain red while the train is on the junction. <br>
<b>Level</b>: User Goal <br>
<b>Multiplicity</b>: There can be only one train on the junction at a time. All three lights are active. <br>
<b>Main Success Scenario</b>: <br>
<ol>
	<li>System checks every second if there is a train on the junction.</li>
	<li>If there is a train (system detects it), put lights of segment 1 and 2 on red. Light 3 can be green, train has to leave junction one time.</li>
</ol>
<b>Extensions</b>: <br>
<ol>
	<li>If there is a train on the junction and one of the incoming segments detects a train, add the new train to the cue of trains on that segment.</li>
	<li>If there is no train on the junction and none of the incoming segments detects a train, all the lights stay red.</li>
</ol>

<h3>UML Sequence Diagram</h3>

The image below shows the UML Sequence Diagram for use case 3. There are three entities, the three tracks and one controller. <br>
The lifetimes of all the entities goes on until the main program is terminated. This is a small part of the life cycle of the entities. <br><br>

The sequence diagram shows the following flow. The controller sends a signal to the junction segment (track 3) and acts according to the returning message. If track 3 says there is a train on the junction, the controller tells tracks 1 and 2 to turn their lights red. The light of track 3 is not set by the controller at this point.<br>
If there is no train on the junction, the controller will look for a train on the incoming tracks 1 and 2. If there is a train detected on track 1, the controller issues a green light for track 1 and a red light for track 2. Analogously when a train is detected on track 2.<br><br>

<h3>Regular Expression</h3>

The regular expression that recognizes this use case is as follows. <br> <br>

^((([^E].*)|(E [12]))\n)*(E 3\n(.*\n)*[^X 3](.*\n)*R [1|2]\n(.*\n)*R [2|1]\n(.*\n)*X 3\n(.*\n)*((([^E].*)|(E [12]))\n)*)$ <br><br>

To make it more clear, the regex is divided in small parts and explained separately. The table refers to the diagram below. <br><br>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Regex</th>
		<th>Explanation</th>
		<th>Diagram</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>^((([^E].*)|(E [12]))\n)*</td>
		<td>anything except E 3</td>
		<td>Group 1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>(E 3\n(.*\n)*</td>
		<td>trains enters segment 3 (junction)</td>
		<td>Before group 6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>[^X 3](.*\n)*</td>
		<td>not X 3 before R 1 or R 2 found</td>
		<td>Before group 7 </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>R [1|2]\n(.*\n)*R [2|1]\n(.*\n)*</td>
		<td>find red lights for both incoming tracks</td>
		<td>Before group 8 till group 9 
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>X 3\n(.*\n)*</td>
		<td>train has left junction</td>
		<td>Before group 10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>((([^E].*)|(E [12]))\n)*)$</td>
		<td>anything except E 3</td>
		<td>Group 11</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>

Below is a diagram that shows the full regex.<br>

<h3>FSA</h3>

The picture below shows the FSA based on the regex above. <br>
Besides the characters needed to go from one state to another, the Python actions are included as well. <br>
State S14 is the true accepting state. If we reach this state we know we have found a good occurence of use case 3 in the trace. <br>
State S15 is only reached when the EOF (of the trace file in this case) is seen. This is not an essential part of the regex but makes the validation terminate smoothly. In the next section, this will be explained more. <br> <br>

<img src="use case3/fsmUseCase3.png" alt="fsmUseCase3">

<h3>Implementation</h3>

The implementation of this FSA can be found in <a href="use case3/scannerUseCase3.py">scannerUseCase3.py</a>. You can find the states and the actions made per transition, as described in the FSA. Some of the actions found in the implementation are not included in the FSA for readability. <br>
For example in state S3, we check if the string "X 3" is found before "R 1" or "R 2". If so, we reject because this would mean that the train left the junction before the lights of the incoming segments are turned red. In state S14 we set the boolean variable <i>self.recognized </i> to True to indicate that an occurence has been found. State S15 is a special state. This is an accepting state because it accepts the EOF. At the end of the trace we stop by going to this state. This a clean way to end the program and to indicate we're done. <br><br>

To run the test program yourself, execute the following command: <b>python testUseCase3.py</b>. Make sure that you use version 2.7 of Python. You can choose if you want to see the whole trace output or just the results by setting the variable <i>__trace__</i> in <i>scannerUseCase3.py</i> accordingly.

<h3>Results</h3>

We've found 109 good occurences of the execution of use case 3 and no bad ones. The program terminates by seeing EOF.

<h3>Workload</h3>

In total 7 hours were spent on this assignment, most on FSA and the implementation in Python.

<h2>Use Case 4 - Beno&#238;t-Philippe Fornoville</h2>
This part will discuss the validation of Use Case 4. Below you can find the full Use Case, the UML sequence diagram, the regular expression and the FSA. The implementation and its results on the given trace file are discussed as well.
<br>
The behaviour of use case 3 is as follows:  if two trains are waiting to enter the junction at the same time, permission will be granted in order of arrival (i.e., the first train to
arrive will get a green light, and the second one has to wait).

<h3>Full Use Case</h3>

<b>Use Case</b>: TwoTrainsAtTheSameTime <br>
<b>Actors</b>: Train on segment 1, Train on segment 2<br>
<b>Scope</b>: Railway Junction Control System <br>
<b>Intention</b>: The train that arrives first should get a green light first. <br>
<b>Level</b>: User Goal <br>
<b>Multiplicity</b>: There are two incoming tracks, with each one traffic light. <br>
<b>Main Success Scenario</b>: <br>

<ol>
	<li>A train arrives at one of the incoming sections.</li>
	<li>A second train arrives at the other incoming section.</li>
	<li>The first train gets a green light</li>
	<li>The second train gets a green light</li>
</ol>

<b>Extensions</b>: <br>
<ol>
	<li>If there are no trains, the FSA should end in an accepting state.</li>
	<li>If there is only one train, it should eventually get a green light.</li>
</ol>

<h3>UML Sequence Diagram</h3>

<h3>Regular Expression</h3>
The following regular expression is written in the Python Regular Expression language. <br> <br>

^(((^E)|(E 3)|(#.*))*((E (?P&lt;trackName&gt;[12])\n(^E)|(E 3)|(#.*))*E [^((?P=trackName)|3)]\n((^G)|(G 3)|(#.*))*G (?P=trackName)\n((^G)|(G 3)|(#.*))*G [^((?P=trackName)|3)]\n)|(E 1\n((^G)|(G 3\n)|(#.*))*G 1\n)|(E 2\n((^G)|(G 3\n)|(#.*))*G 2\n)))*$ <br><br>

<h3>FSA</h3>
The Finite State Automata, implementing the regex above.<br>
<img src="use case4/FSAUseCase4.png" alt="fsmUseCase4">

<h3>Implementation</h3>

The comments are ignored by the states Init, S4, S11 and S15. All the text following a # is ignored until there is a newline. In these states all characters besides either E (states Init and S4) or G (S4, S11 and S15) will be ignored. If an E or G is seen and not in a comment it will transition to the next state.<br>
In state S2 if we see a 1 or 2 we store this value in <i>self.T</i>. In state S9 if we see a 1 or 2, and <i>self.T</i> is not equal to this new value, store the new value in <i>self.T2</i>.<br><br>

To run the program yourself, execute the following command: <b>python testUseCase4.py</b>. Make sure that you use version 2.7 of Python. You can choose if you want to see the whole trace output or just the results by setting the variable <i>__trace__</i> in <i>scannerUseCase4.py</i> accordingly.

<h3>Results</h3>

When we run the program on the trace file, we see that use case 4 is not satisfied. The reason is that at one point a train enters an incoming track and but the controller issues a green light to the other incoming track, which is not as specified in use case 4.

<h3>Workload</h3>

In total 7 hours were spent on this assignment, most on constructing the FSA.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

We can conclude that the program satisfies use case 3 but not use case 4.
