4. If two trains are waiting to enter the junction at the same time, permission will be granted in order of arrival (i.e., the first train to arrive will get a green light, and the second one has to wait).

Use Case: TwoTrainsAtTheSameTime
Actors: Train on segment 1, Train on segment 2
Scope: Railway Junction Control System
Intention: The train that arrives first should get a green light first.
Level: User Goal
Multiplicity: There are two incoming tracks, with each one traffic light.
Main Success Scenario:

    A train arrives at one of the incoming sections.
    A second train arrives at the other incoming section.
    The first train gets a green light
    The second train gets a green light

Extensions:

    If there are no trains, the FSA should end in an accepting state.
    If there is only one train, it should eventually get a green light.
