Use Case: TrainOnJunction
Actors: Train on segment 3
Scope: Railway Junction Control System
Intention: Lights of incoming tracks have to remain red while the train is on the junction.
Level: User Goal
Multiplicity: There can be only one train on the junction at a time. All three lights are active.
Main Success Scenario:

    System checks every second if there is a train on the junction.
    If there is a train (system detects it), put lights of segment 1 and 2 on red. Light 3 can be green, train has to leave junction one time.

Extensions:

    If there is a train on the junction and one of the incoming segments detects a train, add the new train to the cue of trains on that segment.
    If there is no train on the junction and none of the incoming segments detects a train, all the lights stay red.
