3. If a train is on the junction, all traffic lights will remain red until that train has left the junction.

Use Case: TrainOnJunction
Scope: Railway Junction Control System
Intention: Lights have to remain red while the train is on the junction.
Level: User Goal
Multiplicity: There can be only one train on the junction at a time. All three lights are active.
Main Success Scenario: 
	1. System checks every second if there is a train on the junction.
	2. If there is a train (system detects it), all the lights are put on red.
Extensions:
	1. If there is no train on the junction and one of the incoming segments detects a train, turn that segment's lights on green.
	2. If there is no train on the junction and none of the incoming segments detects a train, all the lights stay red.

4. If two trains are waiting to enter the junction at the same time, permission will be granted in order of arrival (i.e., the first train to arrive will get a green light, and the second one has to wait).

Use Case: TwoWaitingTrains
Scope: Railway Junction Control System
Intention: Give permission to one train at a time to enter the junction, based on the order of arrival.
Level: User Goal
Multiplicity: Two trains can require access to the junction, only one train can be on it at a given time.
Main Success Scenario:
	1. Trains A and B are waiting at the junction.
	2. Both lights are red.
	3. System sees which train has arrived first.
	3. System gives permission to the right train by turning its light green.
	4. The other train's light is still red.
